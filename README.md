# Industrial Copper Modeling
Problem Statement The copper industry deals with less complex data related to sales and pricing. However, this data may suffer from issues such as skewness and noisy data, which can affect the accuracy of manual predictions. Dealing with these challenges manually can be time-consuming and may not result in optimal pricing decisions.

# Overview
This project aims to analyze the noisy data using machine learning regression model can address these issues by utilizing advanced techniques and a lead classification model is a system for evaluating and classifying leads based on how likely they are to become a customer.

# Regression Model
The copper industry deals with less complex data related to sales and pricing. However, this data may suffer from issues such as skewness and noisy data, which can affect the accuracy of manual predictions. Dealing with these challenges manually can be time-consuming and may not result in optimal pricing decisions. A machine learning regression model can address these issues by utilizing advanced techniques such as data normalization, outlier detection and handling, handling data in wrong format, identifying the distribution of features, and leveraging tree-based models, specifically the decision tree algorithm.

# Classification Model
Another area where the copper industry faces challenges is in capturing the leads. A lead classification model is a system for evaluating and classifying leads based on how likely they are to become a customer. You can use the STATUS variable with WON being considered as Success and LOST being considered as Failure and remove data points other than WON, LOST STATUS values.

# Solution
Exploring skewness and outliers in the dataset. Transform the data into a suitable format and perform any necessary cleaning and pre-processing steps. ML Regression model which predicts continuous variable ‘Selling_Price’. ML Classification model which predicts Status: WON or LOST. Creating a streamlit page where you can insert each column value and you will get the Selling_Price predicted value or Status(Won/Lost) Domain Manufacturing

# Take Away Skills
The following skills were acquired from the project:

Python scripting
Data Preprocessing
EDA
Streamlit


# Conclusion
The goal of this project is to create an atractive Streamlit application where we can able to analyze the noisy data using machine learning regression model can address these issues by utilizing advanced techniques and a lead classification model is a system for evaluating and classifying leads based on how likely they are to become a customer.
